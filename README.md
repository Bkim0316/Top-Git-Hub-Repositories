Top Trending Repositories

So this project allows you to look at the top trending repositories for the month for Pyhton, Java, and Javascript. When
you first load it up it will show you the top repositories for Python for the month. Then you have other tabs that will show 
you the information for Java and Javascript. Once you are on the selected tab that you would like, it shows you the 
repositories's title and the description for that repository. The title for the Repositories also act as hyperlinks 
allowing you to have direct access to the repository.

This project was deployed using Microsoft Azure Cloud Services and utilizes a REST API 

One thing that you have to do, to access the website and it function as intended is to disable CORS on your selected browser.
Otherwise the information will not show up as intended.
